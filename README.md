# Horiseon-Marketing
Homework Week 1 Project

For this project, I have edited the starter code that was given to us to create the webpage but use more semantic elements within the code. I seperated each section of what was on the webpage and broke it into sections using their classes and ids and labelling these identities on the page so the user can know what is happening on the page.
